## Day 2 Activity File: Incident Analysis with Kibana


After creating your dashboard and becoming familiar with the search syntax, use these tools to answer the questions below:


1. Identify the offensive traffic.
   - Identify the traffic between your machine and the web machine: 

     - When did the interaction occur? 02:42 and 02:44

     - What responses did the victim send back? codes: 301,401

     - What data is concerning from the Blue Team perspective? 
	Too many 401 codes unauthorized. Volume of requests.

2. Find the request for the hidden directory.

   - In your attack, you found a secret folder. Let's look at that interaction between these two machines.

     - How many requests were made to this directory? At what time and from which IP address(es)?
	-192.168.1.90, 16,876 requests,  2:42 through 2:45

     - Which files were requested? What information did they contain?
	-company_folders/secret_folder/connect_to_corp_server

     - What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future?
	-An brute force authentication, block multiple password attempts, and an alarm to detect a large amount 	of GET requests.

     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.
	-don't have a secret folder on your open http server

3. Identify the brute force attack.
   - After identifying the hidden directory, you used Hydra to brute-force the target server. Answer the following questions:

     - Can you identify packets specifically from Hydra?
	Yes. Using user_agent.original:"Mozilla/4.0 (Hydra)
     - How many requests were made in the brute-force attack?
	16,876

     - How many requests had the attacker made before discovering the correct password in this one?
	16,874

     - What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future and at what threshold(s)?
	An alarm for multiple GET and 401 unauthorized. A threshold of a thousand or so.

     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.
	IP block or change how many password attempts are possible in a given time frame. 

4. Find the WebDav connection.
	url.path:"/webdav/shell.php"
   - Use your dashboard to answer the following questions:

     - How many requests were made to this directory? 179
     - Which file(s) were requested?
	shell.php

     - What kind of alarm would you set to detect such access in the future?
	Alarm when an php script is uploaded or queried
	
     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would 		mitigate this attack.
	default to blacklisting .php scripts and only allow through on a 		whitelist trusted sources.

5. Identify the reverse shell and meterpreter traffic.
   - To finish off the attack, you uploaded a PHP reverse shell and started a meterpreter shell session. Answer 	the following questions:

     - Can you identify traffic from the meterpreter session?
	Yes. source.ip:192.168.1.105 and destination.port:4444

     - What kinds of alarms would you set to detect this behavior in the future?
	An alarm that checks against known blacklisted ports

     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.
	Disable or harden webDav
